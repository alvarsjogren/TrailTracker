# TrailTracker

A Minecraft Paper plugin for creating, tracking, and visualizing player movement paths in the Minecraft world.

## Description

- **Visualize Paths**: Display saved paths using customizable particles
- **Manage Paths**: Add descriptions, modify properties, view details, and remove paths
- **Path Detection**: Get notified when traveling on or near a path
- **Configurable**: Customize particles, detection radius, notification frequency and more
- **Permission-Based**: Control who can create, edit, and view paths
- **User-Friendly**: Simple commands with tab completion
- **API**: Developer API for integrating with other plugins

## Example Usage

**Creating a Tour Path:**
1. Start at the beginning of your tour: `/tt start ServerTour`
2. Walk through all the points of interest
3. Stop recording when complete: `/tt stop`
4. Add a description: `/tt describe ServerTour Official server tour route`
5. Modify the path properties: `/tt modify ServerTour radius 5`

**Viewing the Tour:**
1. Show all available paths: `/tt list`
2. Start following the particles: `/tt display ServerTour`
3. When done, turn off the display: `/tt display ServerTour`

## For Developers

TrailTracker provides a public API for other plugins to interact with:

```java
// Check if API is available
if (TrailTrackerProvider.isAPIAvailable()) {
    // Get the API instance
    TrailTrackerAPI api = TrailTrackerProvider.getAPI();
    
    // Get all completed paths
    Map<String, PathInfo> paths = api.getCompletedPaths();
    
    // Get information about a specific path
    PathInfo pathInfo = api.getCompletedPath("MyPath");
    
    // Check if a path exists and is completed
    boolean exists = api.isPathCompleted("MyPath");
}
```

The API provides read-only access to path data for integration with other plugins.

## Upgrading from Previous Versions

When upgrading from an older version of TrailTracker:

1. Back up your `plugins/TrailTracker/paths` folder
2. Replace the old .jar file with the new one
3. Restart your server
4. Your existing paths will be automatically migrated
